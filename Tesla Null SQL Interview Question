ðŸš— Tesla SQL Interview Question  

Problem Statement  
Tesla is investigating production bottlenecks and they need your help to extract the relevant data.  
Write a query to determine which parts have begun the assembly process but are not yet finished.  

---

Assumptions  
- The `parts_assembly` table contains all parts currently in production, each at varying stages of the assembly process.  
- An unfinished part is one that lacks a `finish_date`.  
- This question is straightforward, so let's approach it with simplicity in both thinking and solution.  
- Effective April 11th 2023, the problem statement and assumptions were updated to enhance clarity.

Table: parts_assembly  

| Column Name   | Type      |
|---------------|-----------|
| part          | string    |
| finish_date   | datetime  |
| assembly_step | integer   |

Example Input (`parts_assembly`)  

| part     | finish_date          | assembly_step |
|----------|----------------------|---------------|
| battery  | 01/22/2022 00:00:00 | 1             |
| battery  | 02/22/2022 00:00:00 | 2             |
| battery  | 03/22/2022 00:00:00 | 3             |
| bumper   | 01/22/2022 00:00:00 | 1             |
| bumper   | 02/22/2022 00:00:00 | 2             |
| bumper   | NULL                 | 3             |
| bumper   | NULL                 | 4             |

---

Example Output  

| part   | assembly_step |
|--------|---------------|
| bumper | 3             |
| bumper | 4             |

Explanation  
The bumpers in step 3 and 4 are the only items that remain unfinished as they lack a recorded `finish_date`.
